# nn-doa-template
Simple template for those wishing to participate in the [net neutrality day of action on July 12th](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12/).

This tempalte includes a prominent eye-catching message displayed when a page on your website is first loaded. The page provides a bit of information and links to contact the FCC and congressional reps. Upon clicking the close button, a local storage item is set to prevent the message from being displayed again.

This is designed to be easily dropped in to any website, and as such is entirely client side. This does mean that users with JavaScript disabled will not see the message.

An example can be seen [here](https://shadowfacts.net/nn-doa-template/).
